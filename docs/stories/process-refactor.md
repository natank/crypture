This project is made up of react app developed using Agentic AI. the development is driven by the docs folder.
Our development process in this project is captured by the docs/software-development-plan.md
Though the MVP was well organized, we found things to improve with the backlog and sprint management before proceeding.
We found the following issues:
- Duplicate stories descriptions in product-backlog.md and sprint-planning.md
- Sprint planning.md is growing big as stories added.
- No Product requirement doc exist.

we need to keep organization and traceability between backlog items, requirements and stories.

changes needed:
1. product-backlog.md shall contain a tracking table for backlog items. the table shall include item id and description.
2. Product-requirements folder shall contain separate .md docs with requirements. every doc will be related to a backlog item by name and id.
3. Stories folder shall contain separate .md docs with stories or epics. every story will include related description, acceptance criteria, planning, architecture and task breakdown. every story/epic will be related to the corresponding requirement(s)
4. update the software-development-plan.md 
5. create a demo using a product-backlog item with chain of requirements and story to validate
