A board meeting taking place to decide way forward.
Signifcant functionality already exist (product backlog)
however, mvp and monetization is stuck. no exposure to potential customers.
reason: the team includes a developer using ai agent only. missing other key roles.

We need to decide:
- monetiaztion plan based on current features in the backlog (already working on https://foliocrypto.netlify.app/)
- suggest a team to assist the developer with the above. the team should include at least a product owner, a designer, and a marketer. suggest plan that integrates between these roles. assume roles will be hired via fiverr/Upwork on demand. the plan should include the order of tasks, the dependencies between them, and the expected outcome of each task.
