# Open Letter: Feature Ideas for Board Review

**To:** Crypture Board Members  
**From:** Product Team  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Subject:** Four Feature Ideas for Strategic Consideration

---

Dear Board Members,

We are presenting four feature ideas for your independent review. Each idea has emerged from user feedback and market observation. We invite your unbiased assessment of their strategic value and fit with Crypture's mission.

---

## Idea 1: Partner/Advisor Support

**Concept:** Enable financial advisors or crypto-savvy individuals to manage portfolios on behalf of clients.

**What it means:** Crypture would expand beyond individual users to serve professionals who manage crypto assets for others. This would involve multi-user account structures, delegated access, and potentially a B2B licensing model.

**Considerations:**
- Introduces a new user segment (professionals vs. casual investors)
- Requires user authentication and role-based permissions
- May involve compliance and audit trail requirements
- Represents a shift from consumer-only positioning

---

## Idea 2: Portfolio Sharing (Relative Data)

**Concept:** Allow users to share their portfolio composition with others, exposing only percentage allocations rather than absolute values.

**What it means:** Users could generate shareable links or exports showing their asset distribution (e.g., "40% BTC, 30% ETH, 30% other") without revealing actual holdings or monetary values. Recipients see strategy, not wealth.

**Considerations:**
- Preserves user privacy while enabling social features
- Could drive organic growth through sharing
- Requires link generation and optional expiration/revocation
- Builds on existing export functionality

---

## Idea 3: Portfolio Planning Sandbox

**Concept:** Create a simulation environment where users can model portfolio changes without affecting their actual holdings.

**What it means:** Users could experiment with "what-if" scenarios—adding hypothetical assets, adjusting allocations, and seeing projected outcomes—in a separate sandbox space. Changes in the sandbox do not impact the real portfolio.

**Considerations:**
- Supports education and informed decision-making
- Requires clear UX distinction between sandbox and live portfolio
- Involves parallel data management
- Appeals to users exploring strategies before committing

---

## Idea 4: Change History

**Concept:** Track and display a history of all portfolio modifications over time.

**What it means:** Users would see a chronological log of additions, deletions, and quantity changes with timestamps. This provides transparency, supports error recovery, and enables users to understand how their portfolio evolved.

**Considerations:**
- Increases data storage requirements
- Requires decisions on retention period and history depth
- Foundation for potential "undo" functionality
- Supports performance analysis over time

## Request for Input

We ask each board member to review these ideas independently and provide feedback on:

1. **Strategic fit** with Crypture's vision and target users
2. **Market opportunity** and competitive positioning
3. **Resource considerations** relative to current priorities

Please submit your assessments by the next board session. We will consolidate feedback and present a unified recommendation.

Thank you for your time and perspective.

Respectfully,  
*The Crypture Product Team*
