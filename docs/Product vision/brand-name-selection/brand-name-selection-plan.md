# Brand Name Selection Process

We are focusing on selecting a brand name that aligns with our product vision and values. As always, we would like to follow a structured process to select a brand name that aligns with our product vision and values.

## Applicable Documents

- **Business Plan** (`/docs/Business-Plan/business-plan-draft.md`) - Contains core positioning, target segments, competitive landscape, and strategic messaging
- **Brand Name Requirements** (`/docs/Product vision/brand-name-selection/brand-name-requirements.md`) - Contains core positioning, target segments, competitive landscape, and strategic messaging

## Strategic Context from Business Plan

Based on our business plan analysis, the brand name must reflect:

### Core Positioning
- **Privacy-first architecture** - Non-custodial, local-only data storage
- **No-login experience** - Instant access without accounts
- **Trust & security** - Post-breach market opportunity
- **Simplicity** - Accessible to beginners while serving power users

### Target Segments
1. **Beginners (45%)** - Need clarity, education, no-login simplicity
2. **Privacy-conscious (20%)** - Value data sovereignty, non-custodial approach  
3. **Power users (35%)** - Want AI insights, advanced analytics

### Competitive Differentiation
- Only privacy-first, no-login portfolio tracker in market
- Architecture prevents data collection (can't be copied)
- Positioned against CoinTracker, CoinStats, Blockfolio

### Marketing Messages by Segment
- **Beginners:** "Track your crypto clearly—no expertise required"
- **Privacy-conscious:** "Your portfolio. Your data. Your control."
- **Power users:** "AI-powered insights for serious investors"

## Process

Let's begin with defining the process for selecting a brand name. Here is the complete process, tailored to our strategic context:

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Define brand values and core principles (privacy, simplicity, trust, clarity)
   - Analyze target audience needs (beginners, privacy-conscious, power users)
   - Establish naming criteria aligned with positioning:
     - Memorable and easy to pronounce
     - Available domains (.com, .io) and trademarks
     - Scalable across product lines
     - Conveys privacy/clarity/trust
   - Review competitive landscape (CoinTracker, CoinStats, Blockfolio, Delta)

2. **Brainstorming Session**
   - Generate name ideas based on core values (privacy, clarity, crypto, tracking)
   - Explore naming approaches:
     - **Descriptive:** Clear function + benefit (e.g., "ClearPortfolio")
     - **Abstract:** Evokes feeling/concept (e.g., "Crypture")
     - **Compound:** Combines relevant concepts (e.g., "CryptoGuard")
   - Consider domain availability and trademark conflicts
   - Create initial shortlist (10-15 candidates)
   - Test against segment messaging requirements

3. **Evaluation & Screening**
   - Test names against established criteria
   - Check domain availability (.com, .io, .app priority)
   - Conduct trademark search (USPTO, international)
   - Assess pronunciation and memorability across languages
   - Evaluate alignment with target segment messaging
   - Screen for negative connotations or associations

4. **Stakeholder Review**
   - Present shortlist (3-5 top candidates) to key stakeholders
   - Gather feedback on strategic alignment
   - Test with target segment representatives
   - Evaluate emotional response and brand fit
   - Refine based on feedback

5. **Final Selection**
   - Make final decision based on all criteria
   - Secure domain and trademark protection
   - Develop brand identity guidelines
   - Plan brand launch strategy aligned with go-to-market approach
