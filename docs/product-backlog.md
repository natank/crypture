## üìã Product Backlog

This document outlines the prioritized list of user stories for the Crypto Portfolio Tracker application. It serves as the single source of truth for all planned features and enhancements, structured to deliver maximum user value while supporting an agile, iterative development approach.

The backlog is derived from the product vision and software development plan, focusing first on core functionality essential to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Each user story is written from the perspective of our target users, with clearly defined acceptance criteria to guide implementation and validation.

Stories are grouped by feature category and prioritized based on their importance to user experience, technical dependencies, and overall product goals. This backlog will evolve with ongoing feedback, development progress, and product insights.

## Real-Time Data Integration

### üßæ User Story 4: Fetch Real-Time Prices via CoinGecko API

**User Story**  
As a casual crypto investor,  
I want the app to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices from a public API,  
so that I can view up-to-date valuations of my portfolio.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] 2.1 Upon adding an asset, the app queries a public API (e.g., CoinGecko) for its current price.
- [ ] 2.2 Prices are displayed in the user's preferred fiat currency (default: USD).
- [ ] 2.3 Fetched prices are accurate and reflect current market data (within a reasonable delay).
- [ ] 2.4 If the API is unreachable or fails, a clear error message is shown.
- [ ] 2.5 The fetch operation must not block the UI.

**Notes:**

- Use CoinGecko‚Äôs public API.
- Support only top 100 coins initially for simplicity.

---

### üßæ User Story 5: Real-Time Value Updates on Change

**User Story**  
As a crypto enthusiast,  
I want my total portfolio value to update immediately when I add/remove an asset or when prices change,  
so that I always see the real-time worth of my investments.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] 3.1 When a new asset is added, the portfolio value updates automatically.
- [ ] 3.2 When an asset is removed, its value is subtracted immediately.
- [ ] 3.3 When real-time price data updates, the total portfolio value refreshes accordingly.
- [ ] 3.4 Updates occur without requiring a manual refresh or user action.
- [ ] 3.5 The UI reflects current values consistently across components.

**Notes:**

- Debounce or throttle background updates to avoid API rate limits.
- Useful for future expansion into auto-refresh intervals or WebSocket integration.

---

## UI and Usability

### üßæ User Story 0: Render Portfolio Overview Layout - Done

**User Story**  
As a casual crypto investor,  
I want a clean, structured portfolio page with total value, asset list, and action buttons,  
so that I can view and manage my crypto holdings clearly.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [V] 0.1 The page includes a total portfolio value header.

- Based on mockups in `ui-mockups.md`, aligns with User Story 8.

### üßæ User Story 6: Filter/Sort Assets by Name or Value - Done

**User Story**  
As a casual crypto investor,  
I want to filter or sort my portfolio assets by name or value,

- [x] 6.2 The user can sort by asset value (high to low, low to high).
- [x] 6.3 Sorting options are accessible via a dropdown or toggle interface.
- [x] 6.4 The list updates immediately upon selection of a sort option.
- [x] 6.5 Filter field allows typing to narrow visible assets by name (partial match allowed).

---

### üßæ User Story 7: Handle UI States (Loading, Error) - Done

**User Story**  
As a new crypto enthusiast,  
I want to see clear indicators when data is loading or if an error occurs,

## Extended Features

### üßæ User Story 9: Persist Portfolio in Local Storage

**User Story**  
As a personal finance hobbyist,  
I want my portfolio to be saved between visits using local storage,  
so that I don‚Äôt lose my asset list every time I refresh the page.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] 9.1 The portfolio state (assets and quantities) is saved in browser local storage.
- [x] 9.2 On app load, previously saved portfolio data is loaded and displayed.
- [x] 9.3 Changes to the portfolio (add/remove asset, update quantity) trigger an automatic save.
- [x] 9.4 If no data exists in storage, the portfolio starts empty.
- [x] 9.5 Local storage usage is documented and does not include sensitive data.

**Implementation Summary:**

- Created a `localStorageService` utility to abstract read/write operations.
- Updated `usePortfolioState` to hydrate from localStorage after `coinMap` is ready and `isLoading` is false.
- Prevented premature overwrite using an internal `isHydrated` ref.
- Ensured saving is triggered by all state changes (including empty portfolio).
- Integrated new hook logic in `PortfolioPage` with `coinMap` and loading state.

**Tests:**

- ‚úÖ Unit Tests: Serialization and hydration logic (mocked localStorage)
- ‚úÖ Integration Tests: `PortfolioPage` loads saved data correctly
- ‚úÖ E2E Tests: End-to-end behavior for add, delete, and reload scenarios

**User Story**  
As a developer maintaining this portfolio app,  
I want the Sprint 1 code to follow SOLID design principles,  
so that the codebase is easier to extend, test, and reuse in future sprints.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Feature Category:** Technical Debt

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] 13.1 Each React component and custom hook has a single, well-defined responsibility (SRP).
- [ ] 13.2 Validation logic is decoupled and reusable across components (OCP).
- [ ] 13.3 UI components delegate business logic to separate modules or hooks (DIP).
- [ ] 13.4 No direct dependencies on API services from UI layers (DIP).
- [ ] 13.5 All logic modules are testable in isolation.
- [ ] 13.6 Existing unit, integration, and E2E tests pass after refactor.

**Notes:**

- Applies to files implemented in Sprint 1:
  - `AddAssetModal.tsx`
  - `usePortfolio.ts`
  - `validateAsset.ts`
  - `AssetSelector.tsx`
  - `useAssetList.ts`
- WindSurf analysis will be used to identify violations.
- Results of the refactor will inform standards for future components.
