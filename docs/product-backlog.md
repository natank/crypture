## üìã Product Backlog

This document outlines the prioritized list of user stories for the Crypto Portfolio Tracker application. It serves as the single source of truth for all planned features and enhancements, structured to deliver maximum user value while supporting an agile, iterative development approach.

The backlog is derived from the product vision and software development plan, focusing first on core functionality essential to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Each user story is written from the perspective of our target users, with clearly defined acceptance criteria to guide implementation and validation.

Stories are grouped by feature category and prioritized based on their importance to user experience, technical dependencies, and overall product goals. This backlog will evolve with ongoing feedback, development progress, and product insights.

### üßæ User Story 1: Add Crypto Asset with Quantity

**User Story**  
As a casual crypto investor,  
I want to manually add a cryptocurrency with a quantity,  
so that I can track how much of each asset I own in my portfolio.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] 1.1 The user can enter a cryptocurrency name or symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH).
- [x] 1.2 The user can input a numeric quantity (e.g., 0.5 BTC).
- [x] 1.3 The asset and quantity are added to the portfolio list upon confirmation (e.g., pressing ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù).
- [x] 1.4 Invalid or empty inputs are rejected with an appropriate error message.
- [x] 1.5 The input fields reset after a successful addition.
- [x] 1.6 The newly added asset appears in the portfolio with its quantity and name.

**Notes:**

- No authentication required.
- Price value will be fetched later (see real-time batch).
- UI should be intuitive (e.g., dropdown or autocomplete for asset selection).

### üßæ User Story 2: Delete Crypto Asset

**User Story**  
As a personal finance hobbyist,  
I want to remove an asset from my portfolio,  
so that I can keep my holdings list accurate and up-to-date.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] 2.1 Each asset listed in the portfolio has a visible delete/remove button.
- [x] 2.2 Clicking the delete button removes the asset and its data from the portfolio.
- [x] 2.3 A confirmation prompt appears before deletion (to avoid accidental removal).
- [x] 2.4 Once deleted, the asset is no longer visible in the list or included in calculations.
- [x] 2.5 Deletion works correctly for all supported assets without breaking the UI.

**Notes:**

- This complements the "Add Asset" story for basic CRUD operations.
- No backend or authentication involved.
- Can be implemented via simple state management (e.g., array filtering).

### üßæ User Story 3: Calculate and Display Total Portfolio Value

**User Story**  
As a new crypto enthusiast,  
I want to see the total value of my holdings calculated in real-time,  
so that I can understand how much my portfolio is worth overall.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] 2.1 The application multiplies each asset‚Äôs quantity by its current market price.
- [x] 2.2 The portfolio total value is displayed prominently on the interface.
- [x] 2.3 The total value updates automatically when a new asset is added or an existing one is removed.
- [x] 2.4 The value updates whenever the fetched market prices change.
- [x] 2.5 In case of price fetch failure, the total value should be omitted or show a fallback state.

**Notes:**

- Depends on successful price fetching (see Real-Time Data Integration stories).
- Total should reflect real-time data accuracy.
- This is a key user need stated in the vision for quick, reliable insight.

---

## Real-Time Data Integration

### üßæ User Story 4: Fetch Real-Time Prices via CoinGecko API

**User Story**  
As a casual crypto investor,  
I want the app to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices from a public API,  
so that I can view up-to-date valuations of my portfolio.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] 2.1 Upon adding an asset, the app queries a public API (e.g., CoinGecko) for its current price.
- [ ] 2.2 Prices are displayed in the user's preferred fiat currency (default: USD).
- [ ] 2.3 Fetched prices are accurate and reflect current market data (within a reasonable delay).
- [ ] 2.4 If the API is unreachable or fails, a clear error message is shown.
- [ ] 2.5 The fetch operation must not block the UI.

**Notes:**

- Use CoinGecko‚Äôs public API.
- Support only top 100 coins initially for simplicity.

---

### üßæ User Story 5: Real-Time Value Updates on Change

**User Story**  
As a crypto enthusiast,  
I want my total portfolio value to update immediately when I add/remove an asset or when prices change,  
so that I always see the real-time worth of my investments.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] 3.1 When a new asset is added, the portfolio value updates automatically.
- [ ] 3.2 When an asset is removed, its value is subtracted immediately.
- [ ] 3.3 When real-time price data updates, the total portfolio value refreshes accordingly.
- [ ] 3.4 Updates occur without requiring a manual refresh or user action.
- [ ] 3.5 The UI reflects current values consistently across components.

**Notes:**

- Debounce or throttle background updates to avoid API rate limits.
- Useful for future expansion into auto-refresh intervals or WebSocket integration.

---

### üßæ User Story 7: Handle UI States (Loading, Error)

**User Story**  
As a new crypto enthusiast,  
I want to see clear indicators when data is loading or if an error occurs,
