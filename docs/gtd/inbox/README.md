# Inbox

**Purpose**: Quick capture of all incoming tasks, ideas, and requests without processing.

## How to Use

1. **Quick Capture**: Create a file for any incoming task/idea
2. **Weekly Processing**: Process entire inbox to zero during weekly review
3. **File Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-{brief-title}.md`

## Processing Rules

For each item in inbox, ask:
1. **What is it?** (Clarify)
2. **Is it actionable?**
   - **No** → Move to `../reference/` or `../someday-maybe/`
   - **Yes** → Continue
3. **What's the next action?**
   - **Single action** → Move to `../actions/`
   - **Multiple actions** → Create project in `../projects/`
   - **Waiting for someone** → Move to `../waiting-for/`

## Example Inbox Items
