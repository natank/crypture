# Refine Business Plan for Partner Presentation

**Date:** 2025-01-23
**Priority:** HIGH
**Deadline:** 2 days from now
**Context:** A potential partner wants to schedule a presentation of our business plan to evaluate it for potential investment and partnership. We've committed to being ready in two days and need to refine the current draft into something more polished that we fully stand behind.

## Current Status
- Business plan draft exists at: `/docs/master-plan/Phase 1 - Business Analysis and Backlog Refinement/outputs/business-plan-draft.md`
- Partner is interested in investment and partnership opportunities
- Timeline: 2 days to complete refinement

## Next Steps
- Discuss refining requirements with team
- Identify specific areas that need polishing
- Plan refinement approach and timeline

## Notes
- This is for investment/partnership evaluation - needs to be professional and compelling
- Need to ensure we fully stand behind all content
- Timeline is tight (2 days) - need efficient refinement process
