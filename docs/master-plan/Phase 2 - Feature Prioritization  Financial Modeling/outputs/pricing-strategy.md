|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| $4.99/mo | 8% conversion | Lower revenue, higher volume |
| $7.99/mo | 6% conversion | Balanced |

### Recommendation

Current $9.99 / $19.99 pricing is well-positioned:
- Below psychological thresholds
- Competitive with market
- Room for future increases
- Clear value differentiation between tiers
