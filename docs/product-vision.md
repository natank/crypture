# Product Vision

## Vision Statement

Our vision is to empower everyday crypto investors with a simple, real-time portfolio tracker that offers clarity, control, and confidenceâ€”without requiring technical expertise or platform integrations.

Existing tools are either too complex, require account integrations, or lack transparency and customization. As a result, users lack a simple, centralized solution to track their assets, view current prices, and understand their portfolio's performance at a glance. This leads to confusion, poor investment decisions, and missed opportunities.
