# 📘 Software Development Plan (SDP)

## 1. **Project Overview**

The Crypto Portfolio Tracker is a React + TypeScript application that allows users to manage their cryptocurrency holdings by adding assets, tracking real-time prices, and calculating portfolio value. The app begins as a monolithic component and is refactored using LLM assistance into modular, testable hooks.

## 2. **Objectives**

- Refactor a tightly coupled UI component into clean, reusable custom hooks.
- Improve maintainability, testability, and extensibility.
- Demonstrate LLM-assisted development workflows.
- Build a production-ready React application following software engineering best practices.

## 3. **Scope**

### Initial Feature Set

- Add crypto assets with quantity
- Fetch real-time prices via CoinGecko API
- Calculate and display total portfolio value
- Filter/sort assets by name/value
- Handle UI states (loading, error)

### Future Scope (Backlog Candidates)

- Persist portfolio in local storage or backend
- Add charting (price history)
- Enable user authentication
- Export/import portfolio data

## 4. **Quality Assurance & Bug Tracking**

For detailed information about our bug tracking process, please see the [Bug Tracking Workflow](./bug-tracking-workflow.md) document.

### Key QA Processes:
- **Test Planning**: All features must include test plans in their technical specifications
- **Test Automation**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests are required for all new features
- **Bug Triage**: Regular triage meetings to prioritize and assign bugs
- **Quality Gates**: All code must pass automated tests and code review before merging
- **Release Testing**: Full regression testing before each release

### 🚀 Release Process

1. **Pre-Release**
   - Complete all features for the release
   - Verify all critical and high-priority bugs are resolved
   - Update version number in package.json
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
   - Ensure all tests are passing
   - Perform final QA verification including regression testing
   - Confirm all known issues are documented and triaged

2. **Release**
   - Create release branch (release/vX.Y.Z)
   - Merge to main branch
   - Create version tag (vX.Y.Z)
   - Push tags to trigger CI/CD pipeline
   - Verify successful deployment to staging environment
   - Perform smoke testing on staging

3. **Post-Release**
   - Verify production deployment
   - Monitor for any issues in production
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Conduct post-release review meeting
   - Document lessons learned for next release

## 5. **Development Approach**

- **Agile with Solo Workflow**: Short sprints with planning, implementation, and review.
- **LLM-Assisted Refactoring**: Use ChatGPT to extract and optimize logic into hooks.
- **Refactor-First Strategy**: Begin with restructuring before adding new features.
- **Source Control**: Git with branches for each sprint or task.
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based docs for all phases.

## 6. **System Architecture**

### Before Refactor

```
/src
└── pages/
    └── Portfolio.tsx (monolithic)
```

### After Refactor

```
/src
├── hooks/
│   ├── usePortfolio.ts
│   └── useCryptoPrices.ts
└── pages/
    └── Portfolio.tsx (UI-focused)
```

## 7. **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **API**: CoinGecko or mock API
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Tools**: Git, ChatGPT, Markdown docs

## 8. **Documentation Plan**

The project follows a structured documentation process to ensure traceability and clarity.

### Documentation Hierarchy

1.  **Product Backlog (`docs/product-backlog.md`)**: The single source of truth for all features. Items are tracked in a table with IDs and links to requirements.
2.  **Requirements (`docs/requirements/REQ-[ID]-[Name].md`)**: Detailed product requirements linked to backlog items. Each requirement document defines functional and non-functional requirements.
3.  **User Stories (`docs/stories/STORY-[ID]-[Name].md`)**: Implementation-ready stories linked to requirements. Each story includes description, acceptance criteria, planning, architecture, and task breakdown.

### Traceability Flow
`Backlog Item` -> `Requirement` -> `User Story`

### Artifacts Table

| Document | Maintained By | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `product-vision.md` | PO Agent | High-level goals and success criteria |
| `product-backlog.md` | PO Agent | Prioritized feature list with links to requirements |
| `requirements/*.md` | PO Agent | Detailed product requirements |
| `stories/*.md` | PO Agent / Dev | Detailed user stories and implementation plans |
| `sprint-planning.md` | Scrum Master, Dev | Sprint goals and task breakdown |
| `sprint-progress-tracker.md` | Scrum Master | Daily/weekly progress updates |
| `a11y-utilities.md` | Dev | Shared CSS utilities for accessibility and mobile UX |
| `icon-component.md` | Dev | Guidance and API for standardized, accessible icons |

## 9. **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: For custom hooks (e.g., portfolio logic, price fetcher)
- **Integration Tests**: For state updates and API behavior
- **Manual Testing**: For UI rendering and user workflows
- **Testability Focus**: Refactor for testability using SRP and modular design

## 10. **Pull Request Process & Template**

To ensure consistent, traceable changes aligned with backlog and sprint planning:

- **Template Location**: See `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for the required PR structure.
- **Required Traceability**: Each PR must link to:
  - `docs/product-backlog.md` story section (ID and title)
  - `docs/sprint-planning.md` corresponding sprint/story section
  - Any relevant E2E/Unit test specs added or changed
- **Accessibility Guidance**: Follow `docs/a11y-utilities.md` and `docs/icon-component.md` for focus, touch targets, and icon labeling. Reference these in PRs when a11y is impacted.
- **Content Checklist** (enforced by the template): Summary, Changes, Files Changed, Acceptance Criteria mapping, How to Test, Screenshots (if UI), Notes, Linked Work, and a completion Checklist (lint/tests/a11y/docs).
- **Usage**: When opening a PR on GitHub, the template auto-populates. Fill all sections before requesting review.
