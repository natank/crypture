# üìò Software Development Plan (SDP)

## 1. **Project Overview**

The Crypto Portfolio Tracker is a React + TypeScript application that allows users to manage their cryptocurrency holdings by adding assets, tracking real-time prices, and calculating portfolio value. The app begins as a monolithic component and is refactored using LLM assistance into modular, testable hooks.

## 2. **Objectives**

- Refactor a tightly coupled UI component into clean, reusable custom hooks.
- Improve maintainability, testability, and extensibility.
- Demonstrate LLM-assisted development workflows.
- Build a production-ready React application following software engineering best practices.

## 3. **Scope**

### Initial Feature Set

- Add crypto assets with quantity
- Fetch real-time prices via CoinGecko API
- Calculate and display total portfolio value
- Filter/sort assets by name/value
- Handle UI states (loading, error)

### Future Scope (Backlog Candidates)

- Persist portfolio in local storage or backend
- Add charting (price history)
- Enable user authentication
- Export/import portfolio data

- Update the `sprint-planning.md` with a clear, structured task list for each user story.
- Follow component decomposition practices to isolate UI, logic, and side effects.
- Provide feedback during sprint review and suggest improvements to design or architecture.

**Produces:**

### üé® Designer Agent

**Role Definition:**  
Responsible for creating user interface wireframes, mockups, and visual components that align with the product vision and usability goals. Ensures the design is intuitive and accessible for target user personas, especially non-technical users.

**Responsibilities:**

- Translate user stories and backlog items into wireframes and UI mockups.
- Create responsive layouts suitable for desktop and mobile.
- Define consistent styling components (e.g., typography, buttons, icons).
- Collaborate with the PO Agent to refine user experience for target personas.

```
/src
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/

/src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usePortfolio.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useCryptoPrices.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Portfolio.tsx (UI-focused)
```
