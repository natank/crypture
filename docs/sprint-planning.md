# Sprint Planning

## 🛠️ Story-to-Task Breakdown Strategy

This document outlines the systematic approach used by the Developer Agent to break down user stories into technical tasks. It supports transparent, predictable, and high-quality feature implementation aligned with the product vision.

---

### 🎯 Objective

Convert product backlog user stories into actionable, well-scoped technical tasks for implementation within the sprint.

---

### 🔍 Breakdown Strategy

#### 1. Understand the Story Context

- Identify the user persona and their goal.
- Clarify feature intent and expected behaviors.
- Analyze acceptance criteria as functional checkpoints.
- Note any feature dependencies or ordering constraints.

#### 2. Map Acceptance Criteria to Functional Behaviors

- Each criterion is translated into UI, logic, or interaction behavior.
- These behaviors inform specific component, hook, or service responsibilities.

#### 3. Identify Technical Responsibilities

| Layer            | Description                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI Components    | Render forms, modals, buttons, layout wrappers             |
| State Management | Use React state, reducers, or context to manage data flow  |
| Data Logic       | Transform, validate, and persist asset/price information   |
| Side Effects     | API requests (e.g., price fetch), debounce, error fallback |
| Visual Feedback  | Loading indicators, disabled states, error messages        |
| Accessibility    | Aria labels, focus trap, semantic HTML for usability       |
| Testing          | Unit and integration tests for reusable logic (hooks)      |

#### 4. Group into Logical Development Tasks

Tasks are grouped and labeled by their responsibility type and scoped to be:

- Atomic (one concern per task)
- Independently testable and reviewable
- Appropriately small to complete within a sprint

#### 5. Prioritize by Sprint Scope

Tasks are ordered by:

- Functional dependency (e.g., must fetch price before calculating value)
- MVP necessity (e.g., Add/Delete before Export/Import)
- Reusability and extensibility

---

This process ensures that implementation aligns tightly with user needs, design expectations, and technical best practices.

### 🧾 User Story 11: Import Portfolio from CSV/JSON

**User Story**  
As a personal finance hobbyist,  
I want to import my crypto holdings from a CSV or JSON file,  
so that I can quickly set up my portfolio without manual entry.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] 11.1 The user can upload a `.csv` or `.json` file via an import button or drop zone.
- [ ] 11.2 Valid files populate the portfolio with the imported data.
- [ ] 11.3 Invalid formats or missing fields trigger a clear validation error message.
- [ ] 11.4 The import function preserves existing portfolio items or offers a “replace” option.
- [ ] 11.5 A preview of parsed data is shown before applying the import.

**Notes:**

- CSV format must include at least: asset, quantity.
- JSON structure must match export format.

Here is the **task list for User Story 11** added to the `sprint-planning.md` under the "🟢 FOCUSED Sprint Story: User story 11" section:

## 🔧 Technical Sprint: SOLID Refactor of Sprint 1 Code

**Completed On**: 2025-05-25

### ✅ Summary

Refactored all Sprint 1 modules to follow SOLID principles:

- Decomposed monolithic UI into clean components
- Decoupled logic and side effects into hooks and services
- Validated design, accessibility, and UX alignment
- Maintained full unit/integration/E2E test coverage

**Goal**  
Improve maintainability and modularity of Sprint 1 deliverables by refactoring them to follow SOLID principles. This ensures a scalable architecture as new features are introduced.

**Target Scope**

- `AddAssetModal.tsx`
- `usePortfolio.ts`
- `validateAsset.ts`
- `AssetSelector.tsx`
- `useAssetList.ts`
- `PortfolioPage.tsx`
- `coinGecko.ts`

**Motivation**
The Sprint 1 code meets functional goals but reveals coupling between UI, logic, and data responsibilities. Applying SOLID principles will make the codebase easier to test, extend, and debug in future sprints.

---

### 🛠️ Task Breakdown

#### 1. Static Analysis & Issue Mapping

- [x] Run WindSurf on target files to identify architectural/code smells.
- [x] Create a mapping table of issues to violated SOLID principles.

#### 2. Refactor by Responsibility

- [x] Extract submission and validation logic from `AddAssetModal.tsx` into a custom `useAddAssetForm` hook.
- [x] Create `usePortfolioState.ts` to isolate portfolio state logic.
- [x] Refactor `validateAsset.ts` to be a schema-based validator (open/closed for future validation).
- [✔] Confirmed existing `coinGecko.ts` already satisfies SRP and DIP as service abstraction.
- [x] Refactor `PortfolioPage.tsx` to isolate orchestration logic into reusable hooks or services (e.g., modal control, event handlers).
- [x] Wrap `coinGecko.ts` API logic inside an abstracted service layer (`coinService.ts`) to decouple from hooks and UI (DIP).
- [x] Extract presentational sections of `PortfolioPage.tsx` into reusable components)

#### 3. Dependency Cleanup

- [x] Remove direct API/data-fetching calls from UI components.
- [x] Ensure all hooks/components depend on abstractions, not hardcoded implementations.

#### 4. Testing & Verification

- [x] Update unit tests for new modular hooks.
- [x] Ensure `AddAssetModal`, `usePortfolio`, and `AssetSelector` remain testable in isolation.
- [x] Run and verify all integration tests pass after changes.
- [x] Run E2E tests (`addAsset.spec.ts`) to confirm regression-free behavior.

---

**Definition of Done**

- Code aligns with SOLID principles and passes WindSurf lint rules.
- Refactored components are cleanly separated and testable.
- All tests pass and code coverage remains ≥ previous baseline.
- Future features can reuse new modular components/hooks.

| 5.4 | No **manual refresh** needed — updates are reactive |
| 5.5 | UI reflects current values consistently             |

---

### 🧱 Tasks by Responsibility Type

#### 1. **Hook Refactoring for SRP**

- [x] Create `useCoinList()`
      → Fetch top 100 coins
      → Add polling with `usePolling()`
      → Only update state if prices or timestamps changed

- [x] Create `usePriceMap(coins)`
      → Accepts coin array
      → Returns stable `{ [symbol]: price }` map via `useMemo`

- [x] Refactor `useCoinSearch`  
       → Remove internal fetch logic  
       → Accept `coins` as a prop  
       → Limit to search state + filtered list only

#### 2. **Polling Infrastructure**

- [x] Implement reusable `usePolling(callback, interval)`
      → Cleanup-aware, timer-based polling logic
      → Used by `useCoinList` for scheduled fetches

- [x] Update `useCoinList()` to use `usePolling()` instead of `setInterval`
      → Cleanly refactor polling logic into external reusable hook
      → Ensure cleanup and immediate-first behavior still work

- [x] Detect changes in fetched prices using timestamp diff or deep equality before calling `setCoins()`

- [x] Expose `lastUpdatedAt` metadata to support future freshness indicators

#### 3. **UI Feedback**

- [x] Add Tailwind transition class to total value display: `transition-colors duration-300`

#### 4. **Integration and Wiring**

- [x] Fully remove `useCoinContext` from all components  
       → Replace `getPriceBySymbol`, `coins`, and `search` with hook-based props  
       → Confirm no remaining consumers in AssetList, AssetSelector, or PortfolioPage

- [x] Wire `useCoinList`, `usePriceMap`, and `useCoinSearch` into `PortfolioPage.tsx`
      → Ensure reactive price updates flow to total value and asset list
      → Validate updated props via context or direct hook usage

#### 5. **Testing**

- [x] **Unit Tests**

  - [x] `usePolling`: verify timer + cleanup
  - [x] `useCoinList`: verify polling + deduplication
  - [x] `usePriceMap`: verify memoized mapping

- [x] **Integration Test**

  - `PortfolioPage`: simulate price update, check updated total

- [x] **E2E Test**
  - `real-time-value.spec.ts`: add BTC → mock price update → confirm UI reflects new total

### 📦 Deliverables

| Type              | File / Component                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Hook Enhancement  | `useCryptoPrices.ts`, `usePolling.ts`   |
| UI Adjustment     | `PortfolioHeader.tsx` (animation)       |
| Test: Unit        | `useCryptoPrices.test.ts`               |
| Test: Integration | `PortfolioPage.test.tsx`                |
| Test: E2E         | `src/e2e/specs/real-time-value.spec.ts` |

---

### ✅ Definition of Done

- Total value auto-recalculates on asset and price change
- Prices are polled every 60s using `/simple/price` to stay within free-tier limits
- Batching and last-updated detection avoid redundant updates
- UI reflects accurate, up-to-date totals across components
- All tests (unit, integration, E2E) pass
- Styling and feedback align with `ui-mockups.md` and `style-guide.md`
