### How to handle images?
- Use WebP format with fallback to JPEG/PNG
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- Provide appropriate alt text

### What about animations?
- Use CSS transitions for simple animations
- Consider `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Document complex animations in the code

### How to handle form validation?
- Show inline error messages
- Use ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Implement server-side validation

## Next Steps
1. Review the handoff package
2. Set up initial project structure
3. Implement core components
4. Schedule design QA sessions
5. Regular sync meetings for blockers
